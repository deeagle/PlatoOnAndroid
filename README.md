# PlatonOnAndroid

This is an OpenData feasibility analysis as an Android prototype.

## Why?

Within my master thesis at the TH KÃ¶ln I implemented a web service. This prototype was the first
OpenData test against the API and its documentation.

## What can it do?

At the touch of a button, the data is retrieved via API and displayed with a progress graph. The
picture shows the general UI with two rooms (Campus I and II of the University Library Trier) with
current utilisation in a utilisation graph (libraries are open, utilisation at 11% and 3% with the
coloured representation green').
