# PlatonOnAndroid

This is an OpenData feasibility analysis as an Android prototype.

## Why?

Within my master thesis at the TH KÃ¶ln I implemented a web service. This prototype was the first
OpenData test against the API and its documentation.

## What can it do?

At the touch of a button, the data is retrieved via API and displayed with a progress graph (see
picture).
